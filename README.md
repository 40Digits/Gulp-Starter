# eta

Also known as the Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, sometimes referred to as the Jedi interceptor due to its popularity with Jedi pilots, was a Clone Wars-era Republic starfighter.

For 40Digits, Eta serves as our build script for internal projects. The build script took much inspiration off of graypants' https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter as well as Chris Davies' https://github.com/chrisdavies/gulp_starter_kit

It was modified to work within the needs and requirements of 40Digits development. 

Some notable changes were the introduction of gulp-sprites, but also the modification from libsass to ruby-sass for feature support.
